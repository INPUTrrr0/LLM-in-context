 Have you asked the seller yet where it is? See https://t.co/n4jUdNSd5z as they may be able to help out! ^D
 I have contacted seller but my question to you is when will I receive my product. Your customer service says may be the awb no.  is wrong.
 I don't care about that I want my product. . I wish I had not opted ebay.but in future I am not going to choose eBay . Because Its the worst
" The seller should have delivered it by then, but as you don't have it just see https://t.co/Yh3pSrspGY if the seller can't help! ^D"
 I haven't received it as of yet. And I have a contract with you for the delivery of product not with seller.
" So, instead of telling me to contact the seller you guys should contact the seller."
" The contract is between you and the seller! They shipped it, but we protect you if you didn't get it if you open a case. ^D"
 I haven't received anything as of yet. I'll contact seller tomorrow morning. But your service is pathetic.
 Did you view our link? We can give a refund if you don't get it! Just look at our guarantee for steps on activating it. ^D
 I would appreciate that I got the refund of my previous damaged product from eBay. But where are the timelines for delivery.
 The email address associated with my account is __email__ .
 I'm not looking for the refund. Just check my account and you would yourself condemn your service and worst packing .
 And I haven't received it yet so in layman terms you can say I'm Waiting for it from 9th of Oct. How much time can I wait.
 and so you have provided me the refund for that. But as I was mad about this product so I ordered the same product on 21st .
 I am looking for the product. Let me tell you something. I bought a similar product on 9th of this month. But that was damaged  .
" If you still can't see this, please DM us your full name, Zip code &amp; item number &amp; we'll advise on this date for you. 2/2^ML"
 And check with your team. Or else keep my fucking money as you guys have stressed me out. ?
  kindly check the above message and do the needful for your worst service.
