" What are your targets for next season? I see your prices go up, so I assume you've set performance targets reflective of that."
" These delays are out of our control, but we do work with Network Rail to try and reduce any problems ^CB"
" Oh, that's nice. What are you doing about it? What are you targets next year?"
" I understand the frustration this causes, Andy ^CB"
" Always some supposedly acceptable reason, yes I get that, but when one uses the trains every week and spends a lot of money, for it to be late regularly is just not acceptable."
 Sadly the service has been delayed due to a fault on the line ^CB
 The 06:20 from Euston. Now I'm here waiting on the 19:00 from B'ham int. Also late.
" Hi Andy, really sorry to hear this. Which service are you travelling on please? ^HP"
" For at least the third time this year, I will miss the meeting I especially took the train for in the first place. So often late. No refund because it ""doesn't qualify"". Next season = car."
 Some lines will be reopening shortly so you'll get through but delays are expected ^CB

 Hi. Sorry to hear the buyers have not followed through. Did you open an unpaid item claim? You can set buyer requirements which will block buyers who have strikes against them which will reduce this from happening. See here&gt; https://t.co/5GCQb0IEA0. Thanks ^SG
EVERYTIME i sell something on   the bid comes back as fraudulent and i have to repost.  7 days wasted.  I’m done.  Ugh.
" Hi there. Sorry to hear the item has not arrived. Is there tracking for the item? If not, I'd advise opening an item not received claim. You can learn more about that here&gt; https://t.co/0toc8cKSB0. Any other questions, let us know. ^SG"
" The item has been marked as delivered, and the system would not let me contact ebay customer service directly. It was not sellers fault, it was mismanaged somewhere between shipment and delivery. Still file a claim?"
 Need to contact customer service directly. Please DM contact email for customer service
" As the seller is responsible for the courier, they can claim for lost items from the courier. You still have to open a claim through eBay to be protected. Please follow the previous steps. We cant outbound DM. You can DM us if you have any other questions. ^SG"
" Ok, thank you for your help, I'll do that."
" You're more than welcome. Any other questions, please dont hesitate to ask. Thanks ^SG"

"_support  I think we understand HOW it works, it's just frustrating that it USED to be much more user-friendly before this update."
 _support Yep. This
_support It’s not intuitive. Takes me too long to find the episode I want instead of the episode presented to me.
" We're sorry to hear this, Heather! Anything in particular about the new app that you find frustrating? We're here to help."
  Yep. Challenging. Frustrating. Things you don’t need when you’re just trying to watch Bob’s Burgers.
  It's....very challenging.
I feel it’s important to remind  that its new interface has made watching what you want to watch nearly impossible. Zero stars.

 Have you asked the seller yet where it is? See https://t.co/n4jUdNSd5z as they may be able to help out! ^D
 I have contacted seller but my question to you is when will I receive my product. Your customer service says may be the awb no.  is wrong.
 I don't care about that I want my product. . I wish I had not opted ebay.but in future I am not going to choose eBay . Because Its the worst
" The seller should have delivered it by then, but as you don't have it just see https://t.co/Yh3pSrspGY if the seller can't help! ^D"
 I haven't received it as of yet. And I have a contract with you for the delivery of product not with seller.
" So, instead of telling me to contact the seller you guys should contact the seller."
" The contract is between you and the seller! They shipped it, but we protect you if you didn't get it if you open a case. ^D"
 I haven't received anything as of yet. I'll contact seller tomorrow morning. But your service is pathetic.
 Did you view our link? We can give a refund if you don't get it! Just look at our guarantee for steps on activating it. ^D
 I would appreciate that I got the refund of my previous damaged product from eBay. But where are the timelines for delivery.
 The email address associated with my account is __email__ .
 I'm not looking for the refund. Just check my account and you would yourself condemn your service and worst packing .
 And I haven't received it yet so in layman terms you can say I'm Waiting for it from 9th of Oct. How much time can I wait.
 and so you have provided me the refund for that. But as I was mad about this product so I ordered the same product on 21st .
 I am looking for the product. Let me tell you something. I bought a similar product on 9th of this month. But that was damaged  .
" If you still can't see this, please DM us your full name, Zip code &amp; item number &amp; we'll advise on this date for you. 2/2^ML"
 And check with your team. Or else keep my fucking money as you guys have stressed me out. ?
  kindly check the above message and do the needful for your worst service.
